# Blindnet Openness Framework and Knowledge Base

Blindnet is a software company on a mission to transform the world of software by bringing privacy back to the users, by restoring trust between users and software systems and by helping developers make software that users love and trust.

Trust and privacy can't go without Openness, which is why blindnet fully embraces [Open Organization](./definition.md) principles, and Openness as a whole, as a basis for our collaboration with the community.

In this project, you'll find all the material we create and use to support this idea, including guidelines, tools, documentation, and decisions records.
