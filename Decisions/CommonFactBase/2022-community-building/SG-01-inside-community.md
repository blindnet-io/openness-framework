# Building an inside community

## Context and Problem Statement

Creating a coherent, efficient, and welcoming environment for 3rd party developers.

## Objective

Build an "inside community" with all the required tools and organization frameworks to gather feedback and improve the environment before extending it to 3rd party developers.

During the defined period, all staff members will put themselves in the position of community members and act like so.

Regular updates of our progress will be publicly reported, on social platforms and GitHub, to build awareness and attract potential community members. However, building developer engagement isn't part of this goal, as the following one will address it.

## Timeframe

- Start date: 2022-04-04
- Due date: 2022-05-05

## Motivation

Staff members form a very cohesive and small team.
As a consequence, communication and decision making is mostly informal and synchronous.
This is the most efficient organization for the current context.

However, this organization isn't well suited for community interactions.
As requests and contributions grow, an informal and synchronous community will overwhelm employees, leading to information loss, perceived opacity, and lost opportunities.
As the community building process starts, the consequences of these problems on the public image of blindnet could be catastrophic.

Communication needs a better framework, and some staff members need to acquire a better mastery of some related tools to interact with potential community members efficiently.

## Expected outcome

### Community

Any 3rd party developer can easily have a clear understanding of:

- what blindnet does and stand for
- how the blindnet organization works (from an outsider's perspective)
- where to get the information they need to use the products
- how to communicate with blindnet (especially where to ask a question depending on their context and needs)
- how to contribute to blindnet (both in technical and non-technical areas)

At the end of the defined period, we'll conduct an internal survey to confirm we met these goals.
Optionally, a few 3rd party developers could also join this survey to avoid confirmation biases.

### Staff

During the period, each staff member should have:

- contributed to at least one PR review
- created at least one issue without making any transgression to the guidelines
- contributed to an Open Decision

At the end of the defined period, @noelmace will conduct tests to determine if we meet the following requirements:

- all inquiries should be answered within 12 hours (weekend excluded), being from instant messaging, social networks, email, Github issues, or PR
- all staff members should be able to give a satisfying answer (in form, meaning, and perceived efficiency) to a request from a community member within a week
- all staff members should be able to find a piece of public information fitting their mission within one hour
- all staff members have a sufficient understanding of markdown and git logic

### Outreach

> The following indicators are optional, as building engagement isn't part of this goal.

Interaction on social platforms reached a minimum satisfying level:

- ~150 organic impressions on Twitter per day
- at least one tweet per week with more than five engagements
- average engagement rate on LinkedIn is above 15
- at least one publication per week on LinkedIn with more than five engagements

Most repositories in the blindnet-io Github organization should have more than five stars.

## Obstacles and requirements

All staff members (including direction) will need to contribute to this effort continuously.
Skill improvement and adaptation will take time, which can impact productivity.

Some unspoken misunderstandings could seriously undermine this effort.
The involvement and comprehension of all staff members will need constant monitoring and exchanges with @noelmace (evaluated to 2h/day).

Some new tools may require a supplemental budget.
Associated discussions and decisions will need to be quickly undertaken with @Vuk-MD to avoid slowing down the related efforts.

## Stakeholders

- @noelmace leads the process
- @blindnet-io/engineering help to set up the required tools
- all @blindnet-io/blindnet contribute
