# Blindnet Decision Framework

## What Deciding Means to Us

### Definition

At blindnet, we clearly distinguish _"choices"_ from _"decisions"_.

A **_decision_** is a conclusion or a resolution taken after **collective** examination and which commits us as a group.

A **_choice_** is a conclusion or a resolution someone took individually, therefore binding only the person who has taken it. This framework doesn't say how you should make a choice, as they only apply to you. Never hesitate to make choices, but don't expect others to follow them. If you want people to follow a choice you made, make it a decision.

### Guiding Principles

1. Some decisions need to be made quickly. [Do not get attached to those](./shifting-priorities.md).
2. Unrecorded decisions aren't _real_ decisions. [Record](#recording-decisions) all important decisions to ensure everyone can understand, assimilate and challenge them.
3. No decision is fixed in stone. Decisions can't last without being openly, thoroughly, and repeatedly challenged. Decisions Records have to be updated accordingly.

## Recording Decisions

All important decisions have to be recorded in a Common Fact Base.

We distinguish three types of documents:

- **SMART Goals**, to propose and set a clear collective goal
- **Decision Records**, to record simple decisions which don't require extensive discussions or have already been discussed elsewhere
- **[Open Decisions](./OPEN-DECISIONS.md)**, to collectively find a solution to a complex problem that could impact our culture or drastically affect people outside blindnet

This framework provides a [CFB seed project](./CFB-seed/) with templates to ease and guide decision recording.

### Recording a Decision in This Project

Generic decisions impacting the whole organization should be recorded in this directory (i.e. the "Global Blindnet Open CFB").

Simple decisions can be recorded in a unique document. Just copy the most relevant template, give it a unique id (`XXXX` > `OO19`), edit its content, and make a pull request to discuss it with all stakeholders.

You don't have to write everything directly. Recording a decision isn't about saying _"hey, I made this choice, do you agree"_. Share your thoughts, make people challenge them, and reach a satisfying solution collectively.

More complex decisions may need several documents. When this is the case, create a directory, and follow the [inverted pyramid](https://www.s8080.com/blog-news/writing-detail-pages-information-pages) method.
