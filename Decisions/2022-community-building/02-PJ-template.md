## Problem

Progressively improve our communication tools and contents on top of our ["inside community"](./SG-01-inside-community.md) to welcome early contributors.

### Objectives

Build a welcoming space for a thriving open community.

- Developers hear about us and want to know more.
- Third-party developers think our project is fun and useful, and want to join the party.
- All outsiders can quickly identify how to contribute and make a small contribution in minutes.
- All outsiders can quickly identify where to find any piece of information they need about our company, processes, projects, and tools, including asking us a question or starting/joining a conversation when needed.

### Who May Be Impacted

This project has a broad impact on the whole company, and will therefore concern every staff member.

### What's Happening?

- Phase 1: Plan, Research - progressively completing this draft based on the prototyping + testing phase
- Discussion: [10](https://github.com/blindnet-io/openness/issues/10)

## Team

- @noelmace - lead the project and act as an intermediary and support
- @blindnet-io/engineering - carry most efforts on Open Source, support, and documentation
- @Vuk-BN and @milstan - guidance
- @timnicblind - assistance
- @timnicblind, @Clementinev and @earvinblindnet - act as 0th contributors

## Open Decision Making Targets

Based on our project team's experience and the scope of this project, we are aiming to demonstrate the following [maturity levels](https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/open-decision-framework/tree/master/maturity-model) as we apply the [Open Decision Framework](https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/open-decision-framework):

| Communication |  Transparency  | Release Early + Release Often | Collaboration  |
| :-----------: | :------------: | :---------------------------: | :------------: |
|  ESTABLISHED  | TRANSFORMATIVE |          ESTABLISHED          | ESTABLISHED |

## What We've Learned So Far

### Possible Approaches

1. embrace the Open Organization and Open Source principles
    - We want communications with outsiders to feel as easy and natural as internal communications. For that, we need them to have access to all needed materials
2. instant messaging
    1. use a simple chat platform like Gitter (beta test in April)
    2. OR/THEN open our Slack or a Discord to everyone around May
        - this will require to improve the way we handle it (see [Communication Tools and Usages at blindnet](./communication-tools.md))

### Expected Outcomes

- Onboard 5 or more contributors.
- Receiving at least one constructive feedback which helped us improve our products.
- Receiving at least one external contribution (code or documentation).
- All public repositories on Github have 20 stars or more.

### Constraints

- limited budget (especially for communication tools)
- limited staff members' availability
- lack of information about the characteristics and expectations of potential contributors
- tight schedule: results are expected ASAP

### Assumptions

- Building a welcoming space around our products will help us gather feedback and grow developer engagement.
- Developers are already familiar with Github issues and PR, and so are we (more or less).
- Developers like to contribute when we give them the opportunity.
- Developers don't get magically interested in a project, however good and useful it could be.

### Risks

- As this process drastically changes how staff members work and communicate, some of them can feel lost or left aside.
- Too many discussions and changes can feel overwhelming for staff members.
- Make too many suppositions about what the community expects and needs.
- Not taking enough feedback from staff members into account.
- Assuming all staff members understand and agree with what is done as they stay silent.

### Decision Criteria

1. measurable outreach improvement
2. positive feedback from the community
3. low impact on staff members' productivity

#### Scope

All public communication (including contents, projects and tools) on technical topics.

Out of scope:

- non-technical communications (i.e. not involving third-party developers)
- internal communications (i.e. private projects and communication channels)

#### Tradeoffs

- Most informal / "instinctive" internal communications are replaced with more formal, inclusive, and efficient processes.

### Research

> Actions (feedback processing in progress):
>
> - [Internal Communication Audit](https://github.com/blindnet-io/devrel-planning/issues/11) (report TBD)
> - broadcast messages on Slack (2022-03-30)
> - kick-start openness framework w/ a first meeting (2022-04-05)

## Background

### History + Context

Blindnet is a developer-oriented company.
Our first goal is to help all developers adopt privacy good practices with ease.
This requires developing and maintaining continuous communication with third-party developers.

Building a thriving community is one solution/requirement to address this goal.
We therefore need to build a welcoming et attractive environment for everyone so people want to contribute.

This will require improving our communication based on our new Openness Framework and a thriving "inside community."

### About the Problem

Here, our only focus is to improve communication and community building.

We'll decide:

- what communication tools to use
- how to use them (i.e. defining efficient processes to communicate with third-party developers)
- requirements for a developer portal that meets third-party developers expectation and improve our outreach
  - including new content to create for it
- how to store important knowledge future community members will need

Problems we're **_not_** trying to solve:

- what features need to be part of our products (we'll decide how to manage feedback, not what it should be)
- how to communicate with non-technical people
