# Making Open Decisions

**What it is**

- A flexible, open approach to making organizational and technical decisions and leading projects

**When to use it**

> :warning: Not all decisions have to be Open Decisions. Refer to the [Blindnet Decision Framework](./README.md) for alternatives.

For decisions and projects that are likely to:

- impact our culture or
- drastically affect people outside blindnet

**How to use it**

- Build steps from the Open Decision Framework into your project plan or decision-making process

## What is an open decision?

<table>
<tr>
<td>Transparent</td>
<td>Inclusive</td>
<td>Customer-Centric</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Explain who is making the decision, what problems you're trying to solve, the requirements and constraints involved, and the process you will follow.</td>
<td>Engage others for feedback and collaborate throughout the decision-making process. Seek out diverse perspectives, including potential detractors.</td>
<td>Think of people as customers with competing needs and priorities. When a decision will help some customers, but disappoint others, manage relationships and expectations while getting stuff done.</td>
</tr>
</table>

Open decisions are made using [open source principles](../principles.md)

## How open source principles lead to better decisions

<table>
<tr>
<td>Principles</td>

<tr>

• Transparency with internal customers and other stakeholders<br/> • Customer involvement<br/> • Gain feedback and adapt iterative changes<br/> • Ideation with customers<br/> • Build trust and respect via collaboration 
</td>

• Customer buy-in<br/> • Stronger and faster adoption<br/> • Best ideas win<br/> • Fewer bugs, issues, and unanticipated impacts<br/> • Higher associate engagement<br/> • Decisions aligned to strategy and culture
</td>
</tr>
</table>

## You can't please everyone.

**But when you make open decisions, people feel...**

- I understand why the decision was made and how it aligns with blindnet's strategy, goals, and mission.
- There was visibility to the business requirements, research, and evaluation criteria.
- The decision-making process was inclusive and transparent.
- Although I wasn't the decision-maker, I was able to contribute to the process.
- I may not agree with the decision, but it's clear that the decision-makers understand blindnet's values and culture.
- I might be disappointed, but I wasn't surprised.
- My voice was heard and valued.

<tr valign="top">
<td rowspan=3>
<strong>Lead with transparency</strong><br/>
 • Publish a problem statement and possible approaches<br/><br/>
 • Identify any aspects of the project or decision that cannot be open<br/><br/>
 • Publish your ideation process<br/><br/>

<strong>Build diversity of thought + an inclusive environment</strong><br/>
• Engage internal customers and stakeholders early on, especially those who may disagree<br/><br/>
• Seek out diverse and underrepresented perspectives (geographies, ethnicity, departments, job levels, gender, age, etc.)<br/><br/>
• Champion collaboration and provide channels for feedback<br/><br/>
• Address risks, limitations, and potential cultural impacts, especially with historically controversial issues<br/><br/>

</td>
<td>
 • What is the potential impact on the organization? On the culture?<br/><br/>
 • Who do we need to include in planning?<br/><br/>
 • Whose problem are we trying to solve?<br/><Br/>
 • Who will we need or want help from?<br/><br/>
 • Who else could be impacted?<br/><br/>
 • Who has solved a similar problem?<br/><br/>
 • Who is likely to disagree, dissent, reject, or opt out? Who else may care?
</td>
<td rowspan=3>
There are a handful of issues that often generate controversy and upset within blindnet, including:<br/><br/>
 • Decisions, policies, or changes that impact associates, such as rewards and wellness programs<br/><br/>
 • Changes to associates' work environment<Br/><br/>
 • Implementation of proprietary technology<br/><br/>
 • Use of proprietary formats<Br/><br/>
 • Data privacy and sharing<br/><br/>

If your project or decision involves any of these themes, take extra steps to make your process open, inclusive, and transparent.

# Appendix

## History: Where the Open Decision Framework came from

- Based on principles practiced by open source communities

  - Research by Duke University's Fuqua School of Business and Diana Martin (2009 – 2010); additional community resources

- Developed by the People team, with contributions from cross-functional focus group

  - Grew from People team Project Management Office's effort to create an open project management methodology (2012 – 2013)
  - Google Calendar memo-list conversations served as a catalyst to share drafts with all associates and invite participation (2014)
  - Tested by IT and Engineering, in the Google Calendar bridge working group (2014 – 2015)

- Updated and maintained by Rebecca Fernandez (rfernand@redhat.com)

## Why the framework exists

**A collection of proven practices that:**

- Drive better alignment between business decisions and our company strategy, goals, culture, values, and mission
- Demonstrate "what good looks like" in decision-making and communication
- Offer consistent guidance for teams and leaders on blindnet cultural expectations, balancing transparency and confidentiality
- Improve associate engagement, signal-to-noise ratio on memo-list
