# {short title describe this Open Decision project}

## Problem

Problem statement (_1-2 sentences_)

- Learn more (link to details below)
- Problems we're not trying to solve (link to ever-growing list)

### Objectives

- What you want to do about the problem, in broad terms. Desired future state.
- What "good" would look like, in 1 - 2 sentences that anyone can understand.
- May not be needed, if captured in problem statement.

### Who May Be Impacted

- Hint: they are usually your stakeholder groups and potential stakeholder groups.

## Open Decision Making Targets

Based on our project team's experience and the scope of this project, we are aiming to demonstrate the following [maturity levels](https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/open-decision-framework/tree/master/maturity-model) as we apply the [Open Decision Framework](https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/open-decision-framework):

| Communication |  Transparency  | Release Early + Release Often | Collaboration  |
| :-----------: | :------------: | :---------------------------: | :------------: |
|  ESTABLISHED  | TRANSFORMATIVE |          ESTABLISHED          | TRANSFORMATIVE |

## What We've Learned So Far

- Shoft the wording of headlines like these, as your project progresses

### Possible Approaches

- In the early states, list any option or solution under evaluation or consideration.
  - As your project progresses, update heading (e.g. "Approaches we're testing," then "Proposed solution").
- [Learn about other solutions considered](#) (_link_)

### Expected Outcome

Describe the most important expected outcomes (up to 5). Say what success will look like, and how you expect to concretely mesure it (with metrics and tangible productions).


### Constraints

- Key constraints on the decision or project
- Include relevant legal, reporting, confidentiality, etc. factors (to the extent possible)

### Assumptions

This is where you'll want to state the obvious (and invite others to question your reasoning). Need help?

- [Have You Checked Your Assumptions Lately? | Inc.com](https://www.inc.com/robert-kaplan/have-you-challenged-your-assumptions-lately.html)

### Risks

- Known risks, potential areas of controversy, cultural impacts, unintended impacts

### Decision Criteria

- High-level, most important criteria
- Weighted importance

#### Scope

- Clearly define what's in and out of scope. Link to details explaining why, if needed.

#### Tradeoffs

- When you have to give something up to gain something better, explain it here.

#### Revisiting This Decision

When do you anticipate revisiting this decision? Timeline or criteria or key factors that would contribute.

#### How to Provide Feedback After Launch

- Think about this, then include some version in your fact base at each phase of the project, to demonstrate your willingness to own the outcome of the decision.

### Research

#### Feedback Gathered

- Summarize + link to details
- Changes made based on feedback
- Changes not made, despite feedback (and why)
- Prototype + user testing results
- Post-launch feedback and metrics

#### Data and Findings

- Summarize and link to details

## Background

### History + Context

This is probably the first paragraph of your first draft or launch communications. Sorry, it belongs down here.

### About the Problem

The super detailed version of the "Problem" section goes here.

Problems we're **_not_** trying to solve:

- Related problems that you know people will ask you about
- Related things you wish you could solve, but cannot
- Optional, but very helpful to include

Detailed business requirements:

- Requirement #1: Details here to help others understand it
- Requirement #2: Details here to help others understand it
- Order from most to least important. Include info like weighting, relative importance, etc.
- Link to detailed requirement documents, if it's complex.

#### How We Gathered the Requirements

_Explain the process and stakeholders you worked with, external research, etc. Helps validate them._

- _Link to detailed data, survey results, etc._

### Other Solutions Considered

(could provide a solutions evaluation matrix, instead)

Eliminated early on:

- Name + why
- Name + why

Eliminated later in the process

- Name + why

* Name + why

Good solutions that we didn't move forward with:

- Name + why (e.g. higher cost, might reconsider in the future, etc.)
