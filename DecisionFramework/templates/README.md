# Blindnet Decision Templates

## What Is a Common Fact Base?

A comprehensive set of information that allows all stakeholders (past, present, and future) to have a shared understanding of important facts and information about a given problem, project, or decision.

## How to Use The Blindnet Decision Templates

### Choosing The Right Template

This project provides three different templates:

- `DR-XXXX-template.md` is a simpler, straightforward, and generic "Decision Record" template. It's the most obvious choice to record a simple decision, especially if it's closed to be made or was already made.
- `SG-XXXX-template.md` helps to clearly think and describe an objective to be met following the SMART goal method; It's often the better choice at an early stage of a reflection to specify an overriding objective before building a project around it.


### Decisions to Make Before Publishing

#### Where will you publish?

The ideal place is:

- easy for your project team to update and manage
- easy for your stakeholders to access and navigate

This directory is the ideal place for most blindnet related topics, as it allows us to build a complete common fact base where all pieces of information can be easily linked together.

Yet, we prefer to keep it as small as possible to ease readability and maintainability.
When starting a new complex project with a lot of decisions and information, the best option is often to build an independent Common Fact Base, and to refer to it in the following [Related Projects](#related-projects) section.

#### Who will be able to view this and other documents?

- At blindnet, we default to open. If there's no good reason to restrict access, we try to make it visible to everyone.
- Make sure all parties involved in the addressed topic are comfortable with this. Discuss the risks and benefits whenever needed.
- A few sensitive projects may require to be started with restricted access. Consider slowly opening access in concentric circles.
- If a project is "sensitive" simply because people may react negatively, you can build trust and respect (and [give people time to navigate the grief curve](http://www.whatnextconsultancy.co.uk/blog/managing-change-change-curve.aspx)) by being open from the start.

### Write and Publish

> :construction: WIP: to be generalized (still too specific to `PJ-XX-template.md`)

- Copy and paste a template file in this directory, a wiki page, or collaborative platform (e.g. as a Github issue)
- Fill out all applicable fields.
- Customize as needed. Delete the tops, unused sections, etc.
- Publish early and update often.
  - You could incorporate it into an existing project wiki or website.
  - As your project or decision progresses, continue to build out new sections
    and add details. You might want to break this into smaller documents.
- Use collaboration and feedback features to support your open decision-making process (e.g. comments, polls).

### Make It Comprehensive, Yet Consumable

Use the [inverted pyramid](https://www.s8080.com/blog-news/writing-detail-pages-information-pages) method to organize content.

### Have a Project Charter?

If you completed a [project charter](https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/project-charter-templates-and-guidelines-every-business-need), publish it here in a dedicated sub-repository, as the first piece of your common fact base. As your project progresses, build your common fact base by adding info suggested in this template.
