## Context and Problem Statement

Before making this decision, blindnet only had a mission statement:

> « Helping developers make software that users love and trust. »

A mission only factually states **what** an organization is trying to accomplish.

A purpose statement is necessary to state **why** the organization exist as a collective, and what drives this collective on a daily basis.

A [thorough collective discussion](https://github.com/blindnet-io/communication-management/issues/86) involving all blindnet's staff members has been conducted to address this matter, leading to a simple and straightforward purpose statement everyone agrees on and embrace.

## Decision Drivers

The purpose statement has to:

- state our common values and goals
- be straightforward
- avoid any confusing, ambiguous or jargonistic term
- be short (few words)
- be easy to remember and say

The purpose statement is not:

- a slogan
- a vision statement

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen option

<br/>
<p align=center><strong><em>FOSTERING TRUSTWORTHY TECHNOLOGY THROUGH PRIVACY.</em></strong></p>
<br/>

### Because (Word-by-word analysis)

1. fostering: blindnet is about encouraging, nurturing, empowering people, not providing a miracle solution
2. trustworthy: trust is central at blindnet and yet, this isn't what we directly provide
   - short, clearer and more impactful way to say that than "that we can trust" or any other alternative
3. technology: underlines technology (and therefore the people building it) is central at blindnet
4. through privacy: underline privacy IS what we are standing for (both a mean and an end)

### Positive Consequences

- Clear and unambiguous.
- Reflect all discussed matters.

### Negative Consequences

- This purpose may still be considered too wordy and complex by some.
- "Privacy" may still be considered jargonistic by some.
- "Trustworthy" is a bit of a mouthful.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### "Enabling trust"

- Good, because it is extremely efficient (two words only).
- Good, because it states that **_trust_** is central at blindnet.
- Bad, because it [lacks meaning](https://github.com/blindnet-io/communication-management/issues/86#issuecomment-1112228685)
- Bad, because it doesn't underline blindnet is a _technology/dev centric company_
- Bad, because it doesn't include _[privacy](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/notion-of-privacy/notion-of-privacy.md)_ itself (see [comment](https://github.com/blindnet-io/communication-management/issues/86#issuecomment-1112443641))

### Variations around "Empowering"

> see the definition of ["Power"](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/power) in the Cambridge Dictionary

- Good, because Empowerment has a much greater and deeper impact than enablement. We empower people, organizations, products with trust.
- Bad, because "power" is ambiguous and might be linked in some contexts with authority, which is often confused with authoritarianism.
- Bad, because some might consider the lexical field of "power" is strongly linked with a "negative control" / coercion (over people, of something).

### Removing the word "Privacy"

- Good, because some might still consider "Privacy" jargonistic and redundant with "Trust".
- Bad, because most people still seems to have at least some notion of what it means.
- Bad, because "Privacy" seems mandatory to allow our purpose statement to sound meaningful enough to developers.
- Bad, because "Trust" alone doesn't state on which condition the trust is built.
