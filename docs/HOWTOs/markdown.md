# About Markdown

Markdown is the most commonly used [Lightweight Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language).

It allows to describe a document presentation and content in an highly simple an human readable way.

Like any source code, a Markdown file (with a `.md` extension) is just a simple text file following a pre-defined syntax. You can therefor edit it using any text file editor. Only the presentation (converting the code into HTML, PDF, etc.) requires specific tools.

## Basic Syntax

All Markdown tools support the same basic syntax.

## Mardown in Github

Github allow to use Markdown pretty much everywhere, including:

- in issues and comments
- in Pull Requests
- files (all files with an .md extension are automatically rendered)

It defines its own extensions of basic markdown syntax, with:

- [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/), for more advanced presentations capabilities (like tables or collapsable sections)
- [autolinked references](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls) to refer to Github contents (like issues, pull requests, and commits) more easily
- [diagrams](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams)
- and more.
