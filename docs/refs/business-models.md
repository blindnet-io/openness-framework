# OSS Business Models

> The following models aren't mutually exclusive. Most companies used as examples here do a mix of all these approaches.

## _Open Core_

- Offering a "core" or feature-limited version of a software product as free and open-source software while offering "commercial" versions or add-ons as proprietary software.
- Example: Gitlab is available in two editions, Gitlab Community Edition (the Open Source "cor") and Gitlab Enterprise Edition (with [additionnal proprietary features](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/self-managed/feature-comparison/)). For more details, see _"[GitLab is open core, GitHub is closed source](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/07/20/gitlab-is-open-core-github-is-closed-source/)"_ by Sid Sijbrandij, founder and CEO of Gitlab.

## _Professionnal Services_

- Offering services "around" softwares (e.g. consulting, support, training), as the company making these softwares is the most competent and renowned to address the related topics.
- Once the company gets to a big enough size and reputation, Partner (for companies) and Champion (for individual professionals) programs can be built on top of this offering to increase growth.
- Here, adopting Open Source for software development allows gaining exposure, legitimacy, and traction, on top of which the company can build these services more efficiently.
- Example: [RedHat Profesionnal Services](https://www.redhat.com/en/services)

## _Sofware as a Service_

- Hosting an Open Source software centrally to provide a subscription-based license
- SaaS allows companies to use a software without needing to host and administrate it.
- With Open Source, people can still host the software themselves if they want to. But SaaS offers a better ROI for them in general.
