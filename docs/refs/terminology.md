**_Openness Framework_**

- Global definition of why and how we share data, code, and decisions publicly.
- The Openness Framework includes:
  - an **_Open Organization Program_** (for global non-technical organizational matters),
  - and an **_Open Source Program_** (specifically for open-sourced code and project management).

**_Open Organisation principles:_**

- **_Transparency_**: making data and other materials (including decisions) easily accessible to both internal and external participants
- **_Inclusivity_**: implementing specific mechanisms for inviting multiple perspectives into dialog wherever and whenever possible, with clear rules and protocols for participation
- **_Adaptability_**: adopting organizational policies and technical apparatuses to guaranty flexiblity and resilience of the organization
- **_Collaboration_**: producting more effective and sustainable outcomes through joint work, including with people not affiliated with the organization
- **_Community_**: determining the organization's boundaries and conditions of participation via clear shared values and purpose subject to continual revision and critique

See [Blindnet Openness Principles](../../principles.md)

**_OSP_** (Open Source Program)

- Politic of an organization defining its open-source use, contribution, and creation for strategic advantage.
- :information_source: Most companies defining an OSP do so by defining an OSPO (Open Source Program Office), a specific branch/team of the company in charge of this program, as this could include a wide variety of projects. At blindnet, we consider the OSP to be a core part of the company, and we share its responsibility among all employees.
