# Checklists for blindnet Open Source Projects

## How To Use These Checklists

1. Create an issue for the Open Source project containing the checklist 01
2. Check the boxes to report your progress
3. Add comments to discuss and explain how to fulfill complex requirements
4. Whenever a subtask becomes too complex, open a related issue
   - if using Github, just click on the circle in the upper-right corner of the task
5. Only close the issue after checking all boxes
6. repeat with the next checklist
