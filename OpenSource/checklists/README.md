# Checklists for blindnet Open Source Projects

> Requirements for every Open Source project at blindnet

## How To Use These Checklists

1. Create an issue for the Open Source project containing the checklist [01-set-up](./01-set-up.md)
1. Is the project a library or an end product?
   - library: add the checklist [01-set-up-library](./01-set-up-library.md)
   - end product: add the checklist [01-set-up-end-product](./01-set-up-end-product.md)
1. Check the boxes to report your progress
1. Add comments to discuss and explain how to fulfill complex requirements
1. Whenever a subtask becomes too complex, open a related issue
   - if using Github, just click on the circle in the upper-right corner of the task
1. Only close the issue after checking all boxes
1. repeat with the next checklist
