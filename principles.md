# Our Openness Principles

## Open exchange

Whether you're developing software or trying to solve a business problem, open exchange begins when you share your "source code" with others. A free exchange of ideas is critical to creating an environment where people can learn and use existing information to develop new ideas.

## Participation

When we are free to collaborate, we create. We can solve problems that no one person may be able to solve on their own. And when we can implement open standards, we enable others to participate in the future.

## Release early and often

Rapid prototypes can lead to rapid failures, and that leads to better solutions faster. When you're free to experiment, you can look at problems in new ways and look for answers in new places. You can learn by doing.

## Inclusivity

Good ideas can come from anywhere, and the best ideas win. As everyone has access to the same information, arguments are weighed equally based on the facts supporting them, not who expressed them. Only by including diverse perspectives in our conversations can we be certain we've identified the best ideas, and decision-makers continually seek those perspectives. With that purpose in mind, we collectively take actions to counterbalance prejudices related to age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Community

Communities form around a common purpose. They bring together diverse ideas and share work. Together, a global community can create beyond the capabilities of any one individual. It multiplies effort and shares the work. Together, we can do more.
